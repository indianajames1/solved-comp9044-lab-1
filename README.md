There is a template file named dictionary_answers.txt which you must use to enter the answers for this exercise.Download dictionary_answers.txt, or copy it to your CSE account using the following command:$ cp -n /web/cs2041/20T2/activities/dictionary/dictionary_answers.txt .The autotest scripts depend on the format of dictionary_answers.txt so just add your answers don’t otherwise change the file. In other words edit dictionary_answers.txt:gedit dictionary_answers.txt &amp;On most Unix systems you will find one or more dictionaries containing many thousands of words typically in the directories/usr/share/dict/.We’ve created a dictionary named dictionary.txt for this lab exercise.Download dictionary.txt, or copy it to your CSE account using the following command:$ cp -n /web/cs2041/20T2/activities/dictionary/dictionary.txt .
